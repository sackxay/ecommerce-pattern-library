    <p>It's amazing what the human mind is capable of. Innovating the way we use things is a lost art and can sometimes go by the wayside. With a kendama, it is reccomended to watch some beginner tutorials but then after that, take a break from the videos and see what you can come up with. Chances are the trick you have in mind has already been invtented, but in some instances your way of thinking could invent a new trick that even the pros haven't seen before!</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered how people juggle so well? Maybe you wonder how a tightrope artist balances so well? The first thing they have in common is patience. They weren't just born good at their craft, it took days, months, even years to perfect their craft! And some will tell you that they are still continuously learning new things every day. Well the same could be said about Kendama. No matter how good you get there is always another plateau to ascend to. Got that Whirlwind down? Try a double Whirlwind. Consistent with your Around the World? How about giving Around USA a try? No matter what your next step is, there is more than one way to go about it.
